BEM

Block, element and modifier. 


Our block would be the container of the contact listing so .contact{} for example.

We would have several elements within the Block such as first/last name, contact number, email, possibly a photo?

These elements would be .contact__name, .contact__lastname, .contact__phone, .contact__email, .contact__img.

These elements would then have their own modifiers. Such as .contact__name--large, ..contact__name--blue. Possibly for our image we could have
.contact__img--large, .contact__img--small

Their could be social media buttons in the contact listing? So we would have a block callec .btn then this button would have elements such as text so .btn__text or 
.btn__img. Then modifiers .btn--large, .btn--twitter etc.
